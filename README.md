# JavaScriptCode
## Small projects in JavaScript.

****************************************

### Starter

It is a project part of a course about JavaScript. It is a simple dice game for 2 players. You set the maximum value, then you choose hold values or not. The winner is who has the maximum value first.

### Fibonacci

The fibonacci folder has a function in JavaSript that given a n number, positive and greater than 0, shows us n fibonacci numbers. It is a first try to solve the problem of finding the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci numbers form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. Font [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).


There are two ways for solving this problem: recursive and iterative. My solution is iterative, however, I hope to show you a recursive solution soon.

### DiceGame

Yes, I know, one more dice game hahaha. This simple game is part of a course about DOM. Initially, I had a skeleton to work with, then I developed all by myself the logic of the game. When the user refreshes the webpage, the dices should change their values, and who has the greatest dice value wins, so the h1 HTML element should update, very simple. The first version you can see below:

Then I decided to add a button to roll the dices, and play the game. Play the game using a button is much better than refresh the page, by the way. Also, I changed the background color, as you can see below.
